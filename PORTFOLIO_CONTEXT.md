## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"I built ResearchIQ, an automated research assistant that synthesizes technical analysis and public sentiment into professional research briefs in under 60 seconds. It combines data from 5 sources, leads with reliable technical analysis, and is transparent about data limitations. This demonstrates my systematic research approach and multi-source data synthesis capabilities."

## Talking Points

### What Problem Does It Solve?
"Investment research is fragmented and time-consuming. ResearchIQ systematizes the process by aggregating technical indicators, sentiment metrics, and news into one professional brief - saving 30-60 minutes per asset."

### What Makes It Different?
"Most tools either dump raw data or make black-box predictions. ResearchIQ synthesizes multiple sources with explicit confidence levels. It's honest about what free data can and can't provide."

### What Did You Learn?
"Balancing data quality with API constraints, importance of transparent communication about limitations, and how professional design builds credibility for analytical tools."

### Why This Tech Stack?
"FastAPI for fast async processing, free APIs to demonstrate working within constraints, Tailwind for rapid professional UI development, WeasyPrint for high-quality PDF generation."
