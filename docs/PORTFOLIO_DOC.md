## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Vercel Backend Serverless Limitations
**Challenge:** Wanted to deploy full stack to Vercel but backend exceeded 50MB serverless limit

**Attempts:**
- Removed weasyprint (30MB)
- Downgraded pandas/numpy to lighter versions
- Created api/ directory with Mangum ASGI adapter
- Attempted various vercel.json configurations

**Solution:**
- Split deployment: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Render
- Learned when serverless is appropriate vs traditional hosting

**Learning:**
- Serverless perfect for Node.js and simple Python functions
- Complex Python apps with large dependencies better on traditional hosting
- Right tool for the right job - don't force a solution

### 2. React Migration from Vanilla JS
**Challenge:** Original prototype was vanilla JS but needed scalability for production

**Solution:**
- Migrated to React 18 + TypeScript
- Implemented shadcn/ui for professional UI components
- Added Recharts for data visualization
- Used Framer Motion for animations

**Learning:**
- Component reusability crucial for complex UIs
- TypeScript prevents bugs before they happen
- Modern frameworks essential for maintainability

### 3. AI Reliability & Prompt Engineering
**Challenge:** AI responses sometimes included markdown code blocks instead of clean JSON

**Solution:**
- Implemented JSON extraction from responses
- Added retry logic (2 attempts)
- Graceful degradation (report works without AI)
- Structured prompts for consistent output

**Learning:**
- AI is powerful but unpredictable
- Always have fallback plans
- Prompt engineering is a skill worth developing

### 4. Free Tier API Limitations
**Challenge:** NewsAPI free tier only provides headlines, Reddit has rate limits, Google Trends often returns 429 errors

**Solution:**
- Transparent confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/CONTEXT)
- Graceful degradation when sources fail
- Clear documentation of limitations
- Leading with most reliable data (technical analysis)

**Learning:**
- Free APIs have constraints - be transparent about them
- Don't oversell capabilities
- Users appreciate honesty about data quality

## Portfolio Talking Points

### "Tell me about a challenging project you've worked on"
**Answer:**
> "I built InvestIQ, a full-stack investment research platform that aggregates data from 5 APIs, performs technical analysis, and uses Google Gemini AI for enhanced insights. The most challenging part was deployment - I initially tried deploying the Python backend to Vercel's serverless platform but hit the 50MB function limit due to pandas and numpy dependencies. This taught me when serverless is appropriate versus when traditional hosting is better. I ended up with a split architecture: React frontend on Vercel for instant cold starts, and Python backend on Render for the heavier processing. The entire project costs $0 to run while maintaining full functionality, which shows cost-conscious engineering."

### "How do you integrate AI into applications?"
**Answer:**
> "In InvestIQ, I integrated Google Gemini AI not just for basic tasks, but for genuine value-add. The AI acts as a 'co-analyst' that spots patterns pure math misses - like identifying when technical indicators are bullish but social media mentions spike 300%, suggesting FOMO. I implemented smart caching with 1-hour TTL to reduce API costs by 80%, and ensured graceful degradation so the app works even when AI fails. Most importantly, I framed it educationally ('data suggests' not 'you should buy') to avoid giving investment advice. This shows I can leverage AI thoughtfully while understanding its limitations and maintaining user trust."

### "Describe your deployment experience"
**Answer:**
> "For InvestIQ, I deployed using a modern CI/CD pipeline where pushing to GitHub auto-deploys to both Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend). I used infrastructure as code with render.yaml for reproducible deployments and configured environment variables separately for dev and production. I also learned about serverless limitations - attempted to deploy the entire stack on Vercel but hit function size limits, which taught me to choose the right platform for each service. The project demonstrates real production experience beyond just making things work locally."

### "What's your approach to API integration?"
**Answer:**
> "InvestIQ integrates 5 different APIs with varying reliability. I used async/await with asyncio.gather to fetch data in parallel, improving speed by 3x. Each source has explicit confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) so users know data quality. When sources fail, the system degrades gracefully - if Google Trends returns 429 errors, the analysis continues with other sources. I also implemented rate limit handling and retry logic. This shows I understand real-world API challenges and design for resilience."
